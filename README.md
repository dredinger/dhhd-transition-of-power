## :pizza: Webex Bot

The bot lives on an AWS EC2 server located in US West (N. California) region. In order to stop/start/update the bot, you must log directly into the instance via the EC2 management console [here](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#Instances:v=3). Provided the user account has been provisioned correctly, you can connect via the EC2 Instance Connect option (leave the username as is).

### :star: Starting
